# VS Code Settings
Keeping a copy of the settings I have configured for VS Code on my MBP. This does assume that Oh My Zsh and Python 3 are installed already.

## Python Setting

## Terminal Settings

To have zsh load in the integrated terminal window, the following setting has to be configured. It changes the default shell from bash to zsh.
`"terminal.integrated.shell.osx": "/bin/zsh"`

To have the same font used in iTerm with all of the symbols, an additonal setting is required that changes the default font to the same one used with Oh My Zsh in iTerm.
`"terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "Meslo LG M DZ for Powerline"`
